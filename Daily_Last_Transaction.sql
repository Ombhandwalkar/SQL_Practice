You are given a table bank_transactions that records every transaction made at a bank. Each transaction includes a unique ID, the amount transacted, and the timestamp of when it occurred. Your task is to identify the last transaction that happened on each day.

Write an SQL query that returns one transaction per dayâ€”the one with the latest timestamp. Your output should include the id, created_at, and transaction_value of each such transaction. The final results should be sorted by the created_at timestamp.
